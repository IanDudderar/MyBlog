HW0: Indroduction
Hello! My name is Ian and this is my first time using GitHub. Hopefully by the end of this course I will be much more familiar with it.


HW1:
Attributes of good software include acceptability, dependability and securty, efficiency, and maintainability. This ensures that the software will be understandable to the users and the machines they may use, as well as be secure and not cause major damage in case of failure. It should also not waste resources and should be created so that it can be changed and upkept along with the changing needs of customers. Other attributes that may be useful could be that is it small and does not take up excess space, cost effective, accurate and performs the task at hand, and be written so that others may understand the code.

I think depending on what the software engineer is being asked to perform, a license could be required. However I think there are many jobs and uses where something as official as a license, like a doctor, would seem excessive. The book states that engineers cannot be perfectionists, and following that logic I don't think you can create a licensed standard. However, if something is being designed with extremely dangerous or secure info some sort of a license could be required.

ACM/IEEE clause examples
Public- Workers should not use their knowledge to bypass or leak information of the general public.
Client and Employer- Engineers spend their time working to achieve the standards and requirements set by the persons contracting the software.
Product- Software engineered to detect or diagnose an illness for example must be at the highest standards to achieve it works properly.
Judgement- Engineers must not be bias or alter a project for own self-gain.
Management- A team of individuals needs to be managed appropriately to ensure that projects are completed accurately.
Profession- Persons should not pursue or program software that may be used for malicious intent and cause harm to the image of the company.
Colleagues- Lots of projects are group efforts and you must support and encourage those around you to create a positive work environment.
Self- One can only improve if they notice their own flaws and practice their craft.

Working on a system of this magnitude creates obvious moral conflict due to the privacy invasion that comes with it. Going further, the development of this type of system can and will lead to the development of further systems which are even more morally incorrect. What the software is being used for may not even be the issue, but one must also consider what the program is capable of being used for. One may argue that the invasion of privacy is necessary to prevent terrorism, and while in a vacuum this could be correct, the posibility of the technology being used for other things besides terrorist prevention is very clear and possible.
