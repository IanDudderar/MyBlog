HW0: Indroduction
Hello! My name is Ian and this is my first time using GitHub. Hopefully by the end of this course I will be much more familiar with it.


HW1:
Attributes of good software include acceptability, dependability and securty, efficiency, and maintainability. This ensures that the software will be understandable to the users and the machines they may use, as well as be secure and not cause major damage in case of failure. It should also not waste resources and should be created so that it can be changed and upkept along with the changing needs of customers. Other attributes that may be useful could be that is it small and does not take up excess space, cost effective, accurate and performs the task at hand, and be written so that others may understand the code.

I think depending on what the software engineer is being asked to perform, a license could be required. However I think there are many jobs and uses where something as official as a license, like a doctor, would seem excessive. The book states that engineers cannot be perfectionists, and following that logic I don't think you can create a licensed standard. However, if something is being designed with extremely dangerous or secure info some sort of a license could be required.

ACM/IEEE clause examples
Public- Workers should not use their knowledge to bypass or leak information of the general public.
Client and Employer- Engineers spend their time working to achieve the standards and requirements set by the persons contracting the software.
Product- Software engineered to detect or diagnose an illness for example must be at the highest standards to achieve it works properly.
Judgement- Engineers must not be bias or alter a project for own self-gain.
Management- A team of individuals needs to be managed appropriately to ensure that projects are completed accurately.
Profession- Persons should not pursue or program software that may be used for malicious intent and cause harm to the image of the company.
Colleagues- Lots of projects are group efforts and you must support and encourage those around you to create a positive work environment.
Self- One can only improve if they notice their own flaws and practice their craft.

Working on a system of this magnitude creates obvious moral conflict due to the privacy invasion that comes with it. Going further, the development of this type of system can and will lead to the development of further systems which are even more morally incorrect. What the software is being used for may not even be the issue, but one must also consider what the program is capable of being used for. One may argue that the invasion of privacy is necessary to prevent terrorism, and while in a vacuum this could be correct, the posibility of the technology being used for other things besides terrorist prevention is very clear and possible.



HW4:
Consider the FBI's Sentinel project. The FBI wanted to make information more readily accessible in order to prevent further attacks such as 9/11. By replacing paper files with digital ones, they could create a virtual case file and perform their jobs more efficiently. The only issue is that such a simple and comprehensible idea is not always an easy technical fix. The series of articles documents the trials and tribulations of the Bureau over a span of almost ten years! Trying to combat the challenges of inefficient budget combined with the misjudged time frame, they seemed to miscalculate on so many levels. In a rapidly growing industry of technology, these delays can sometimes result in completely wasted projects, as things progress, and requirements and technical abilities grow. The FBI managed to make an eventual comeback, celebrating the eventual release of their Sentinel, despite the many bumps encountered along the way. Not to be outdone, however, the up-and-running Sentinel did not go as planned and required many expensive fixes and adjustments. The roller coaster of feelings in the entire tale is quite intriguing. 

When you combine the Sentinel saga with the other articles on security and failures, some things start to become clearer. Project planning is very important and requires diligence and adequate time. Poor planning and project management will greatly contribute to the rapid downfall of an idea. While it is important to be prepared, it is also absolutely essential to realize that not everything can actually be planned out, and you must prepare for things to not go as planned. No matter how precisely the work is planned things can and will go wrong, and workers must be able to quickly understand and adjust these issues as things move along. This must be achieved on a deeper level so that the systemic factors are recognized. Systemic factors investigate not just the issue at hand, but further into WHY such an error was made in the first place. It is dire essential that these are realized so that future infractions will be prevented, instead of just patched after recognition, as frequently by this time irreversible damage has already been done. To build on this further, the resilience of the project must be considered so that when issues are encountered all is not completely lost, similar to the Apollo 13 mission.

On top of everything else, the only true way to check for issues is to actually test for them. Teams must adequately test their programs throughout the entire process, not just at the end. Tests need to be thorough and include any and all possibilities of inputs. This becomes even more important when you consider the security aspects of certain designs. If an application such as online banking has not been actively certified it is left more vulnerable to outside attacks. Not only is this compromising to the users in that their data has been breached, but it can also reduce the availability of the system, generating even larger issues. If something has to be taken offline so that it can be repaired, user access is limited or even halted, and in the example of online banking, people may be temporarily locked out of their accounts if such a thing has not been planned for or tested against.
